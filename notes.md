Reusability - classNames generic enough to be used across products/categories

- if no previous price, layout should not be impacted

New:

- Picture tag in HTML - enables app to load different images based on screen size
- @media CSS - similar to above, enables us to apply different styles in different contexts, e.g. differing screen sizes or orientations

Questions:

- Used 750px as boundary for mobile to desktop, but is there a standard/convention?
- Should we set a default font size in CSS (i.e. under "\*"), or apply by class/id?
